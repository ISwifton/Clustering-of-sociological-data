# Clustering of sociological data
The script TSNE_clustering.ipynb gets sociological data from file data.cvs. The data include persons' description features such as Country, Specialization, Academic degree, Job, and Stable Income. Then we create the pairwise distance matrix to minimize the number of clusters. The distance between two descriptions is the number of feature mismatches. So we can group the people with similar features into one cluster. To make the clustering, we use the t-SNE algorithm with the number of clusters defined by the KMeans method. The clustering procedure gathers samples (persons) in groups according to their descriptions (features).
To build sociological portraits, we use raw sample data from the file raw_data_3.csv. The script sociological_portraits.ipynb finds the most frequent combinations of features in the data set and prints them along with their frequency.
